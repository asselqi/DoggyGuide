# DoggyGuide



The purpose of our app is first to help the dog owner with daily care,
such as alerting him to feed the dog or take him out for walk.
Secondly, the goal is to help the dog owner to communicate with other dog owners
at the Technion in a convenient way,
such as finding someone who can Keep the dog when needed or "play dates" with other dogs.
And finally, its goal is to conveniently link the dog owner to the organization,
such as announcing vaccines, training or treatments that should occur soon.

P.S. this app is being deveolped under a technion android development course, 
     the original repo is protected, whcih 
     explains why I had only one commit and this much code.
